In figure \refig{overview_very_long} we can see the result of a simulation where all planets have completed several orbits. The orbits appear to be ellipses with different eccentrisities, which are quite near $0$, like in the real solar system. Pluto has a strong eccentrisity, which places its orbit closer to the Sun than Neptune's in a small area around its perihelion. Also, PLuto's orbit isn't as static as the proper planets', probably due its low mass and strong eccentrisity.
