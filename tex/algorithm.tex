The aim of the simulation is to solve equation
\refeq{newtonDifferential}. This will be done by employing the
Runge-Kutta 4th order numerical integration scheme.

% Choice of numerical method
When solving this kind of differential problems, the choice of
integration scheme is of severe importance. Choosing a less
accurate method might provide incorrect solutions and if the
problem has exceedingly rapid changes a more stable (implicit)
integration scheme must be considered.

Considering the huge time scale, even with the scaled units. This
problem will not provide solutions with such rapid changes.
Therefore it is sufficient to choose the RK4 scheme. The local
trucation error is on the order of $O(\D t^5)$ and the global error
is on the order of $O(\D t^4)$. Again, considering that the time is
of unit years, this error is small ``enough'' as to avoid
monumental errors in the solutions.

This means that for example choosing $\D t = 1 \cdot 10^{-2}$ years
will produce a global error proportional to $\D t^4 = 1 \cdot
10^{-8}$ years which is approximately 0.32 seconds.
