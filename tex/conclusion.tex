We have seen that the RK4 solver gives high precision in solving systems of
differential equation. One of the disadvantages is that the Runge-Kutta scheme
doesn't conserve energy, which is quite noticable at high time steps. Stability
becomes a significant problem at these time steps. One could
then instead implement a symplectic integrator like the Euler-Cromer scheme,
that conserves energy for any given $dt$.
