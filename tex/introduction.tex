The aim of this project is to create and run a simulation of the
solar system with a varying number of celestial objects. This
problem will, via Newton's second law, take on the form on a second
order differential equation describing the orbit of each object.
This can be solved using a numerical integration sceme like the
Runge-Kutta of 4th order.

Simulating the solar system will provide a set of challenges. Good
units must be chosen in order to avoid errors in the representation
of numbers. Also, the implementing procedure might carry on to get
very complex and require a lot of maintenance unless it is done in
an object oriented manner.

After implementing and solving the equations for simple cases, for
example the Sun-Earth system, more complex systems with all planets
are also solved. Discussions on circular orbits and escape
velocities are also included.
