Knowledge of the trajectories of the different objects in our solar
system is important for many modern astrophysical aims. The
different orbits can be calculated using the gravitational
attraction between objects. This results in a set of differential
equations. Solutions can be found by simulating the development of
systems via a numerical integration scheme. It is found that the
choice of numerical method is important --- the Runge-Kutta 4
scheme can propose problems in conservation of energy.  An
equilibrium between stability, exactness and correct physical
properties must be sought.
